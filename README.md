## prs.js - A small Javascript module for building parser combinators

Had to build a parser and wrote this instead.

The module is in ```prs.js```

To run the tests: ```node test.js```

The tests are a small scripting language and interpreter for the scripting language. The parser/syntax tree is built [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jscriptparse/blob/main/scripty.js) the runtime for the interpeter is [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jscriptparse/blob/main/rt.js) 

(don't judge the scripting language too harshly, it is my new tinker toy - very much a work in progress)
 
## Documentation of the module

See the [generated documentation](https://mosermichael.github.io/jscriptparse/out/index.html)


## what I learned while writing this project

i am learning about interpreted languages (such as python, php, javascript, perl, etc...) 
I keep noticing quite a lot of details, while writing my little interpreter, I keep them [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jscriptparse/blob/main/notes/notes.txt)

The moral: any kind of project can teach you quite a lot of unexpected thinks! (i think the important part is to keep notes, otherwise you tend to forget this stuff...)
