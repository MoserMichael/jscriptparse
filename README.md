## prs.js - A small Javascript module for building parser combinators

Had to build a parser and wrote this instead.

The module is in ```prs.js```

To run the tests: ```node test.js```

The tests are a small scripting language and interpreter for the scripting language. The parser/syntax tree is built [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jscriptparse/blob/main/scripty.js) the runtime for the interpeter is [here](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jscriptparse/blob/main/rt.js) 

(don't judge the scripting language too sharply, it is my new tinker toy, very much a work in progress)
