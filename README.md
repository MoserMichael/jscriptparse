## prs.js - A small Javascript module for building parser combinators

Had to build a parser and wrote this instead.

The module is in ```prs.js```

To run the tests: ```node test.js```

## Documentation of the module

See the [generated documentation](https://mosermichael.github.io/jscriptparse/out/index.html)
